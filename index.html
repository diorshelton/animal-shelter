    <h1>Wild Cat Rescue</h1>

    <p class="intro">Wild Cat Rescue began in 1997  with a mission to take care of
      endangered wild cat breeds and large cats breeds that may be be
       down on their luck and need a home. We never turn away a kitten
       looking for a home. Over the years we've fostered and become a 
      forever home to over 500 cats.</p>

    <h2> Our Current Residents</h2>

      <p class="name">Iago</p>
      <p>Iago came to us all the way from Brazil after being found looking
        for food in someone's dumpster. He's a sweet guy that likes bacon, backrubs and swimming.
        He's really good at climbing trees and jumping fences. We always have to keep an eye on him.

      <p class="name">Lorraine</p>
      <p>This little trickster looks serious but she's all fun and games. Lorrain was given to us by
        her owner because she couldn't care for her anymore. She's been with us since 2015. She loves
        playing hide and go seek. She's great at finding the best hiding spot and will jump out and scare
        anyone who gets too close. She doesn't bite too hard.

      <p class="name">Gerald</p>
      <p>Our buddy Gerald is one of the oldest residents at Wild Cat Rescue. He loves naps and feeding time.
        He isn't as active as he used to be but if you put a steak in front of him he'll run just like the old days.
        We're not really sure where Gerald came from. He just showed up on our doorstep one day with a sign that said "I live here now."
        we just went with it. We sure are happy to have him.
